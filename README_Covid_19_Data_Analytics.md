```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. **Database**: Requires a database to store and query data. Check `.env` for the database connection configuration.
3. **Tableau**: Optional, but necessary for visualizing Tableau workbooks if you plan to explore the Tableau visualizations.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Covid-19-Data-Analytics
   ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database** (Optional):
   - Run the SQL scripts in the `Database/` folder to create tables and import initial data.
   - Ensure the `.env` file is configured with the correct database connection details.

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The `Dataset/` folder contains the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dataset files.
   - Run preprocessing scripts in the `Models/` directory to clean and prepare data for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explore various models within the `Models/` folder, including clustering and time-series models, to uncover patterns and insights.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Use the Tableau workbooks in the `Tableau/` folder for data visualizations.
   - Additional visualizations may be generated using scripts within the `Models/` folder and saved to the `Images/` directory.

### Running Models

Each model in the `Models/` directory focuses on a specific aspect, such as clustering, predictive modeling, or statistical analysis. Follow the instructions within each script to train and test models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, normalizes, and integrates data from the Johns Hopkins dataset.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Groups regions or periods based on COVID-19 data to identify trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Time-series models predict future cases or vaccination rates.
- **Database Support**: Stores processed data for quick querying and analysis.
- **Visualization**: Tableau visualizations and additional plots for in-depth analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Data preprocessing, modeling)
- **SQL** (Database setup and management)
- **Tableau** (Data visualization)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data handling)
- **Scikit-learn, Statsmodels** (Machine learning and statistical modeling)
